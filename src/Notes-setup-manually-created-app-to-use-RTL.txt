    Manually Setup Webpack and Babel To Use RTL
  ============================================
go to https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#react-with-babel

1. Scroll down to REACT With Babel:
     npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react
     add in babel.rc: 
        "@babel/preset-react"
     Add to webpack.config:
        Add to rules section:
           test: /\.(js|jsx)$/,     
        add to resolve section:
          extensions: ['*', '.js', '.jsx'],
     That's it:

2. Scroll down to "React with web pack"
     npm install --save react react-dom

    In your src/index.js, you can implement your entry point into the React world:
          import React from 'react';
          import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

          const title = 'React with Webpack and Babel';

          ReactDOM.render(
            <div>{title}</div>,
            document.getElementById('app')
          );

        The React DOM API takes two arguments. Whereas the first argument is 
     the rendered JSX from React, the second argument is the HTML element 
     where it should be integrated into the DOM. Since it expects an HTML 
     element identified by an id attribute, we need to add this element in 
     our dist/index.html file:

         <div id="app"></div>
     
     Start your application: npm start

3. Scroll to Hot Module Replacement in React:  
     npm install --save-dev react-hot-loader
        
     Second, add the configuration to your webpack.config.js file:
       const webpack = require('webpack');
       plugins: [new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()],
       add in devServer Section:
          hot: true,

        Third in the src/index.js file, you have to define that hot 
     reloading is available and should be used. Add:
         module.hot.accept();
     
        Last but not least, create your first React component. 
     In your src/index.js file, import a not yet defined App component:

     Then create App.js in .\src and the following content:
           import React from 'react';

          const App = ({ title }) =>
            <div>{title}</div>;

          export default App;

    Congratulations, you have created your first function component and passed props to it. 
    That's it for a minimal React setup with Babel and Webpack.
    
================================================
4. SETUP REACT TESTING LIBRARY
  
       After the setting up in Jest or Vitest, you will learn how to render a 
   React component in a test with React Testing Library. We will use 
   the following function component called App component from a src/App.js file:

    - go to https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-library/ and scroll down 
                 
    - Scroll down to: "React Testing Library: Rendering a Component"


    STEP1. Let's read up about React Function Components
          https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component/

          React Function Components -- also known as React Functional Components --
       are the status quo of writing modern React applications. In the past, 
       there have been various React Component Types, but with the introduction
       of React Hooks it's possible to write your entire application with just 
       functions as React components. (Do a separate demo project later)

         This in-depth guide shows you everything about React Function Components.
       Study it well. 

    STEP2. After reading up about function components, go back to  
        - go to https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-library/ 
         and scroll down to: "React Testing Library: Rendering a Component"
    
        - copy code to App.js (see comments in App.js)


        - create src/App.test.js and the following:
               import * as React from 'react';
                  import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

                  import App from './App';

                  describe('App', () => {
                  it('renders App component', () => {
                     render(<App />);

                     screen.debug();
                  });
                  }); 
            See comments in App.test.js

         

    
 2. After testing above scroll down a little bit more and click 
     "Continue Reading: Testing React Components with React Testing Library"
     This will take you back to "https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-testing-library/"
  
  8. Read this link again and go to "Custom React Setup" to setup JEST 
     and React Testing Library" yourself.  
        - you can download a React Boilerplate project from 
          github https://github.com/rwieruch/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup.
          This boiler project has already webpack and babel setup. But dont use it.
          Create your own React project using create-react-app and set it up yourself.
       
     STEP1:
        npx create-react-app manually-setup-react-app
          
        Bring up code in VS Studio Code and understand the project files:
        A good reference in pluralsight in React is:
           https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/clips/a028fa58-7f10-4613-9d46-0b4885bba5a7          
    
 
     STEP2: Install important extensions"
          npm install -g prettier
          go to VSCode and install "Prettier Code Formatter" and "Prettier Eslint" extensions

     STEP3: React With Babel- https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/#react-with-babel
         npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react
        

     STEP4: React with Webpack

     STEP5: Hot Module Replacement
